Description: 'qps' implements the IV-based method of treatment effect estimation using 
  Quasi Propensity Scores (QPS), introduced in Narita and Yata's "Algorithm is Experiment" (forthcoming).
  This package provides a simple set of functions for QPS estimation, treatment effect estimation, and 
  off-policy evaluation, along with some diagnostic tools. The package supports the use of model objects from 
  a wide variety of ML packages in R. Please contact the author if there is not yet support for a model you wish to
  use.
